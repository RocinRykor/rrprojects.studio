    <h1>About Me!</h1>

    <p>
        My name is Steven Briggs, I am 31 years old, currently living in
        Washington for the past several years after moving from Arizona.
        <br />
        Up until now I have been programming as a hobby, I am self-taught in
        Java and have been using it for the past 5 years.
        <br />
        I am currently looking to branch out, extend my skills with other
        languages and make programming my career!
    </p>
